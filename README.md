# neo4j-mobility-airports

## Description
In this project I'm showing how to manage huge amount of geo-localised Twitter data within [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com). Data are taken from users "overlapping" the [25 busiest european airports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_busiest_airports_in_Europe) in the last three years. The dataset has been built over users that at least once are passing through an airport area, emitting a tweet. Users are then traced in their movements through consecutive locations back and forth in time.

### Credits
Twitter data have been collected by [IFISC](https://ifisc.uib-csic.es/en/) for research purposes. Thanks to [LARUS](http://www.larus-ba.it) for the support in the graph database procedures and management.
