## Description
In this project I'm showing how to manage huge amount of geo-localised Twitter data taken from users "overlapping" the [25 busiest european airports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_busiest_airports_in_Europe) in the last three years. The dataset has been built over users that at least once are passing through an airport area, emitting a tweet. The user is then traced in his movements back and forth in time.
